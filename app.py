- ‚ñ∫ This project was part of one of my chapters of my doctoral thesis through an American direct-to-consumer retailer company.
- ‚ñ∫ It marks the first empirical approach which establishes the sales elasticity of emotional displays in sales pitches.
- ‚ñ∫ We apply state-of-the art artificial intelligence technology to almost two years of video footage (17,312 hours or 62.32 million frames), in which a TV host makes her/his sales pitch to customers, to detect human faces and Salesperson‚Äôs facial emotions are then extracted and classified into six emotional displays: happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, fear, and disgust. We, then, matched them to customers' purchase data to understand the true nature of the relationship. To estimate sales elasticity, we incorporate emotional displays in sales response models together with marketing mix activities (i.e., product, price, display duration, and free shipping).
- ‚ñ∫ We found that the sales elasticities of a host's emotional displays are uniformly negative, including that of happiness, which is a provocative finding (against ‚Äúservice with a smile‚Äù policy) because it partially contradicts the external validity of social contagion theory. In other words, emotional displays in sales pitches are hazardous to business, salespersons should pitch with neutral expressions (i.e., absence of emotion). Additionally, we found that the presence (versus absence) of a host‚Äôs face in the frame positively increases sales by 0.62%. Therefore, the study offers guidance to firms on re-training low performers on ‚Äúselling with a straight face‚Äù as well as to reward successful hosts
